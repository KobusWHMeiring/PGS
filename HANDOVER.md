# Handover — the context budgets are closed and enforced; D80's PRD is next

> ## START HERE — `--check` is green and is now the gate's first step; D80 is next
>
> **`CONTEXT_CUTS_PRD` is `Done` (2026-11-03, session `1d`).** All 12 steps: the chat split, the
> six file cuts, the **14 §18.3 rows** (14 breaches → **0**, largest row 3689 → 1499 bytes) and
> **the budget check as `scripts/verify.sh` step 1/4**. `scripts/verify.sh` **green: 1610 passed /
> 1 skipped**, **183.57 / 132.78 / 59.97 s** across three runs on this box; step 1/4 printed `every budget holds`,
> so the check proves itself on every run. `scripts/fast.sh --critical` **172 passed / 4 deselected
> in 46.53 s** and still names the same eight files.
>
> **The rows' links were not links** (`testing_hazards.md` §3.29). Cutting 14 rows to "a sentence
> and a link" found that **12 of the 14** pointed at paths that do not exist from the spec's own
> directory — bare basenames for PRDs in `In Progress/`, `Refinement/` for one that had moved to
> `Done/` — and **D47 had none at all**. 11 further rows had the same defect; all 81 are
> repo-root-relative now, and `tests/tools/test_context.py` fails on any unresolvable row token
> (watched red). **A missing artefact is now a breach too:** `size_of()` returns `(0, 0)` for an
> absent path, so a deleted `HANDOVER.md` would have read as "inside its budget".
>
> **The state block below had drifted three sessions** — it still said live was `8d2839d`, 70
> commits behind, with the old PDF corpus, and that the dev box was current. Corrected in
> `1793a1e` **against git and `corpus_check`**, not against the previous prose. **The §3.27 deploy
> window is not debt:** `06bb11a`'s `deploy.sh` still pulls origin's tip, but it carries the
> re-exec, so the next deploy verifies afresh before the backup and the first migration.
>
> **What is next, in order:**
>
> 1. **D80 / G12/X2 — but a PRD first.** `todo.md` says the ingestion engine "needs a PRD before
>    it can be built", and **the first commit in any case is the eight-shape fixture set**: numeric
>    rows without labels, headerless value rows, column-major interleaving, a 1,107-character cell,
>    deliberate empty cells, a row across a page break, a two-level qualifier structure, artwork in
>    a cell. The spec's measured starting point is 44 reviewed rows across four documents, four
>    bespoke test files and **two tables still mangled** (SAOSO Appendix 6a ships 20 chunks with no
>    column meaning; Appendix 7 is interleaved) — so **which of the eight already have a test is the
>    first thing to establish, not a fact to inherit.** Start a **fresh session**: this is different
>    work from what `1d` was doing.
> 2. **`product/design/f3_saoso_outreach_and_role.html` is untracked** — 24 KB, "F3 — SAOSO
>    outreach and the digital systems role", dated 2026-11-03, referenced by no PRD. Commit it with
>    a backlog line or delete it.
> 3. **Do not refresh the dev corpus.** `corpus_check` here reports `landscape` **drift** and its
>    17 chunks carry **0** labelled renditions against live's 8; a refresh without
>    `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the dev `.env` writes 17 NULL vectors that then read "already ingested"
>    forever (`deploy/README.md` §4). **Live is the reference DB.**
>
> **The landscape is closed** (session `0z`): UAT re-signed against `c4c362e`, 6 PASS;
> `LANDSCAPE_TABLES_PRD` in `Done/`; `TABLE_BANDS` and the corpus-level table-page guard carried
> into D80 by name.
>
> **Do not run `scripts/build_corpus.py --force` on a document with a table block** — the generator
> has no table-block rule and replaces the review with column soup while every guard stays green
> (`testing_hazards.md` §3.25). That rule is D80's first real commit.
>
> **"corpus is current" does not mean "rebuilt"** — drift compares the artefact's hash and the
> chunk count, not the derived text (`testing_hazards.md` §3.24). After a chunker or parser change,
> `ingest_standard --doc <x> --force` then `relink_evidence --apply`.

**For:** the next agent.
**From:** the corpus-and-retrieval, public-site, documents, chatbot, column, embedding,
answer-coverage, budget-and-instrument, deployment, reader-structure, corpus-artefact,
corpus-drift, retrieval-baseline, deploy-and-close, generator-and-fixture, landscape-artefact,
display-model, shapes-build, cost-rule-and-P4, context-budget, context-frame,
landscape-sign-off, chat-split and handover-truth-up sessions
**Repo state:** `main` — **`origin/main` is at `06bb11a` (pushed and live) and everything since is
unpushed**: the licence commit, the chat-split follow-ups, the six test/generator cuts, the flake
fix, `1c`'s close, and session `1d`'s (the truth-up, five row batches, the link guard, the gate
wiring, the PRD close). **Count it, do not quote it:** `git rev-list --count origin/main..HEAD`
(21 at the close of `1d`) — this line said "8" and "59" in the same file and both were wrong.

**On this tree** (2026-11-03, session `1d`): `scripts/verify.sh` **green at 1610 passed /
1 skipped**, run as `DATABASE_URL=postgres://pgs:pgs@localhost:5433/pgs_verify` (the gate defaults
to 5432 and this box serves 5433, `testing_hazards.md` §3.1). Quote that run as the number for this
tree: **183.57 s cold, 59.97 s warm** — quote the range, never the best run (§3.17).
`scripts/fast.sh` (the lane) measured **172 passed / 4 deselected in 46.53 s warm** with
`--critical`.

**Remote:** `origin` = `https://github.com/KobusWHMeiring/PGS.git` — **19 commits unpushed**.
**Live:** `https://organicguarantee.africa` on the homtini VPS at **`06bb11a`**, deployed
2026-11-03 with a **current** corpus (401 chunks). Its `deploy.sh` on disk is the pre-`3c2c39d`
one, and **the §3.27 window is self-closing, not debt**: that script still `pull`s origin's tip,
but it already carries the re-exec, so the next deploy re-runs the fixed script, which verifies
origin's tip afresh and fast-forwards to *that* — before the backup and the first migration
(`deploy/README.md`: "re-executes itself if the pull changed it"). No manual fix is owed.
**The dev box is NOT current — it is behind live**, and says so: `corpus_check` reports
`landscape` **drift**, and its 17 landscape chunks carry **0** labelled renditions against live's
8. Do not refresh it until `GEMINI_API_KEY` is in the dev `.env` (it holds only
`DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`), or the refresh writes 17 NULL vectors that then report "already ingested"
forever (`deploy/README.md` §4). Live is the reference DB.

## Session archive

History, verbatim, one file per session. **Read only the session a task sends you to.**
